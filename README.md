Embedded Computing\n 
Course Description:\n
This course teaches the principles of using computing in the larger context of a system. The student is expected to enter this class with an understanding of computer architecture, assembler, and proficiency programming in the C (or related) language. Emphasis is given to multimedia data (images, audio, graphics) as examples of processing found in an embedded system. In concurrent lab work, each student will design and implement many of the ideas that are found in a digital video camera.
